# Tabber---Final---Working

WELCOME TO THE CURRENT MVP FOR MY COMPUTER SCIENCE: ADVANCED TOPICS PROJECT. THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO 
AUTOMATICALLY TAB OUT MUSIC BASED OFF OF AUDIO INPUT.

THIS BUILD OF THE PROJECT USES AN FFT (FAST FOURIER TRANSFORM) WRITTEN BY jipsim ON GUITHUB FOR THEIR ZenTuner PROJECT. 
ALL FILES UNNECESSARY TO THE FFT AND IMPLMENTATION OF IT ARE DELETED AND REMOVED OT MITIGATE THE CHANCE OF FALSE ERROS, 
CONFLICTS, AND ANY MISCOMMUNICATION OF WHAT I MYSELF HAVE WRITTEN.

IN ITS CURRENT STATE IT CAN IDENTIFY ALL OCTAVE OF NOTES, BUT DUE TO THE AMOUNT OF WORK IT TAKES TO PRODUCE CHORDS FOR
EVERY OCTAVE, ONLY POWER CHORDS FOR E5 - Eb5 (0 2 2 POWER CHORD TO 11 13 13 POWER CHORD) WILL BE DISPLAYED NO MATTER 
THE OCTAVE. AN ADDITIONAL REPOSITORY WILL SOON BE HOME TO THAT IN-PROGRESS VERSION.

THANK OYU FOR YOUR INTEREST IN THIS PASSION PROJECT OF MINE.
